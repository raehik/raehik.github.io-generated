    <h1>Record additional full zsh history</h1>
    <p class="meta">Oct 12, 2014</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p>I like to keep my shell history free of duplicates and limited size (so
I don&#39;t have to manually rotate it). However, after reading <a href="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life">that
Stephen Wolfram
post</a>
from my <a href="../../../../2014/10/08/things-that-are-cool-analysing-your-life">last
post</a>,
I&#39;ve realised just how much I want to see my full command history: the
embarrassing misspellings, the endless lines of <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code>... It&#39;s a
neat idea, I want to be able to analyse how I use my computer(s).</p>

<p>I did <strong>not</strong> want to change how my actual shell history was stored,
since I didn&#39;t have a problem with it. So somehow, I would have to store
all commands I type in a separate file, and preferably easily because I
am an incredibly lazy hacker. Hmm. (This is where <code>zsh</code> comes in.)</p>

<p>For those of you who use it, it should come as no surprise that <code>zsh</code>
does indeed have a feature for this. <code>zsh</code> has some special functions
you can define which are run on certain events. The <code>zshaddhistory</code>
function is executed <em>&quot;when a history line has been read interactively,
but before it is executed&quot;</em> according to its entry in <code>zshmisc</code>. Any
time you write a command which <code>zsh</code> can parse, this function will be
run, as long as you&#39;ve defined it.</p>

<p>So all we have to do is get <code>zshaddhistory</code> to write the argument it
gets to a file. I&#39;d also like to record the current date and time,
because I want to do more than simply count my commands. This is almost
<em>too easy</em>. To your <code>.zshrc</code>, add:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">zshaddhistory<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="c"># prepend the current epoch time</span>
        <span class="c"># $1 includes terminating newline already (see zshmisc(1))</span>
        <span class="nb">echo</span> -n <span class="s2">&quot;$(date &quot;</span>+%s<span class="s2">&quot;) $1&quot;</span> &gt;&gt; <span class="s2">&quot;$HOME/.zsh_full_history&quot;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Now every command you type is logged to <code>$HOME/.zsh_full_history</code> along
with the exact time.</p>

<p>I did come across a small problem with this simple approach: when
exiting with Ctrl-D, there is no newline present, but <code>zsh</code> still calls
<code>zshaddhistory</code> (with an empty argument). The exit line now looks
identical to an empty line, which I have rather a lot of in my command
history. To fix this, we can use another special <code>zsh</code> function,
<code>zshexit</code>:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c"># clean up the line when exiting with Ctrl-D                                    </span>
    <span class="c"># if Ctrl-D is hit, there isn&#39;t a terminating newline -- so we&#39;ll add a  </span>
    <span class="c"># useful message which probably won&#39;t ever be written (! specifies an    </span>
    <span class="c"># event, so it&#39;ll only work surrounded in quotes                         </span>
    zshexit<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>                                                              
        <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;!EXIT!&quot;</span> &gt;&gt; <span class="s2">&quot;$HOME/.zsh_full_history&quot;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Add that to your <code>.zshrc</code> too, and every time you exit the shell,
<code>!EXIT!</code> will be added to your full history log. I chose that string
because it&#39;s unlikely to ever be added to the history, since the &#39;!&#39;
will cause a parse error. If you ever exit the shell with the <code>exit</code>
command, then you&#39;ll get this line right after without a date before it.</p>

<p>Some example history could be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">1413054363 ls
1413054364 exit
!EXIT!
1413054368 !EXIT!
1413054377 tail $HOME/.zsh_full_history
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can see that there were 2 exits there: the first done using the
<code>exit</code> command, and the second 4 seconds after by Ctrl-D. Originally,
all that mattered to me was that Ctrl-D lines could be easily skipped
programatically -- but this also records the time at which you exit a
shell, which might be cool to look at.</p>

<p><em>2014-10-14 edit: I have found that occasionally <code>!EXIT!</code> will *</em>not**
have a date put before it &gt;:( -- I fixed this by appending the date
after !EXIT! every time:*</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">zshexit<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;!EXIT! $(date &quot;</span>+%s<span class="s2">&quot;)&quot;</span> &gt;&gt; <span class="s2">&quot;$HOME/.zsh_full_history&quot;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p><em>This does mean that properly-formed exit lines have another date on
the end (usually the same, though rarely a second later), but that can
just be disregarded when looking at it. It at least means that *</em>all**
exit lines have a date attached.*</p>

<p>... Now I feel it&#39;s not complete, that I need to log when shells start
too. This is pretty simple, as you&#39;d imagine: since <code>.zshrc</code> is read by
interactive shells on startup, we add just one line to it:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$(date &quot;</span>+%s<span class="s2">&quot;) !START!&quot;</span> &gt;&gt; <span class="s2">&quot;$HOME/.zsh_full_history&quot;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>And that&#39;s that! Now you can be safe in the knowledge that your shell
history is being logged, if that makes you feel safe for any reason.
Eventually I&#39;ll write a program to parse and analyse the log to get some
nice figures.</p>

<p>(The examples in this post are not identical to what is in my <code>.zshrc</code>:
see
<a href="https://github.com/raehik/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.zshrc">raehik/dotfiles/home/.zshrc</a>
for my full config.)</p>
